# Kaldi Vosk Voice To Text (VTT) client with OSC output

This Python script acts as a client interface with a Vosk Voice To Text server for real-time voice transcription. It currently outputs transcription results as OSC over UDP, but the plan is to expand this much further.

Future plans include:
- Javascript/HTML5 interface.
- Allowing transcriptions to be sent via RESTful API.
- Implementing transcription retention in a database.
- Transcription of imported audio files.
- Visualisations and analysis (word-clouds, tables, etc).
